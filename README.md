This is a repository containing artifacts related to the standardization efforts for "Securely COmmunicating NEtwork PROperties" (SCONEPRO), formerly known as SADCDN.

At this time, the primary focus is on refining the charter prior to balloting.

The current working version of the proposed charter is available [here](https://github.com/mjoras/SCONE-PROTOCL/blob/main/documents/charter.md).

We welcome comments on open issues and PRs. We do ask that contributors create issues for specific questions, before creating proposed text for those questions in PRs.

Corresponding discussion also happens on the [sadcdn mailing list](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/sadcdn/).
